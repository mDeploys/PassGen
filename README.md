## Activation Dashboard

For developers/sellers managing premium activations:

### Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Set up Supabase database using the schema in `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Configure environment variables in `.env`

### Running the Dashboard
```bash
npm run dashboard
```
Then open http://localhost:3001 in your browser.

**Note:** Make sure you have express and resend installed:
```bash
npm install express resend
```

### Features
- 📊 View activation request statistics
- 📋 Manage pending activation requests
- ✅ Generate and send activation codes
- 📧 Automated email notifications
- 🔍 Track payment methods and revenue

### License Keys (One-time)
To sell pre-generated keys (for online stores), use:
```bash
npm run gen:license-keys -- --count 20 --plan cloud --termDays 180
```
- Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to insert hashes into Supabase.
- Keys are stored **hashed** only; keep the printed keys safe for distribution.

### Database Schema
The dashboard uses Supabase with the following tables:
- `activation_requests` - Stores user activation requests
- `dashboard_stats` - Aggregated statistics view

### Security
- 🛡️ All activation codes are cryptographically generated
- 🔐 Uses HMAC-SHA256 with seller secret
- 📧 Emails sent via Resend API
- 🚫 No user data stored permanently
### Security
- 🛡️ All passwords encrypted with AES-256
- 🔑 Your master password never leaves your device
- 🔒 Zero-knowledge architecture
- 🚫 No telemetry or data collection

## Download

Get the latest Windows installer from the public downloads repo:

https://github.com/mDeploys/PassGen/releases

## User Guide

See the full usage guide, including the Developer tools tab:
https://github.com/mDeploys/PassGen/blob/main/USER_GUIDE.md

## System Requirements

### End Users (Desktop App)
- OS: Windows 10/11 (x64). macOS 11+ / Ubuntu 20.04+ if you build your own installer.
- CPU: 64-bit dual-core or better
- RAM: 4 GB minimum (8 GB recommended)
- Storage: 300 MB free (plus space for vault and backups)
- Display: 1280×720 or higher
- Internet: required for activation, cloud sync, and updates (local vault works offline after setup)

### Passkey / Windows Hello (Optional)
- Windows Hello enabled (PIN or biometric)
- Secure origin (packaged app or dev running on localhost)

## Browser Extension (Beta)
- Folder: `extension/`
- Load as unpacked in Chrome/Edge (enable Developer Mode), then paste the session token from the Vault footer into the extension options.
- After pairing, the extension detects login forms and autofills the first matching credential by domain.
- Security: The desktop app serves a loopback-only bridge on `127.0.0.1:17865` and requires a session token; secrets are returned only on explicit fill.

## Security Notes

- **Master Password**: Choose a strong master password. This encrypts all your stored passwords.
- **Never Forget**: Your master password cannot be recovered. Store it safely.
- **Cloud Credentials**: Your cloud storage credentials are stored locally and encrypted.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Passwords are encrypted before being sent to cloud storage.
- **Local-First**: Even with cloud storage, all encryption happens on your device.
- **Activation Security**: Premium activation uses install ID + email + seller secret for secure verification.

# PassGen v1.0.2

This release includes all polish and distribution improvements.

## Highlights
- New Help → About PassGen dialog with version and quick links.
- Updated app icon and packaging so Windows refreshes pinned icons.
- Onboarding page is more responsive on small windows (scrollable, tighter spacing).
- Fixed splash/onboarding logo paths so assets render in production builds.
- Fixed QR code display in upgrade modal ("Scan to pay on phone").
- Icon sync script ensures updated public/icon.png is used in installer.

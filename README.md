- RAM: 4 GB minimum (8 GB recommended)
- Storage: 300 MB free (plus space for vault and backups)

- Internet: required for activation, cloud sync, and updates (local vault works offline after setup)

### Passkey / Windows Hello (Optional)

## Browser Extension (Beta)
- Folder: `extension/`

- **Never Forget**: Your master password cannot be recovered. Store it safely.
- **Cloud Credentials**: Your cloud storage credentials are stored locally and encrypted.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Passwords are encrypted before being sent to cloud storage.
- **Local-First**: Even with cloud storage, all encryption happens on your device.
- **Activation Security**: Premium activation uses install ID + email + seller secret for secure verification.

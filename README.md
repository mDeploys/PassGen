## Download

Get the latest Windows installer from the public downloads repo:

https://github.com/Jalal-Nasser/PassGen-Releases/releases

## Browser Extension (Beta)
- Folder: `extension/`
- Load as unpacked in Chrome/Edge (enable Developer Mode), then paste the session token from the Vault footer into the extension options.
- After pairing, the extension detects login forms and autofills the first matching credential by domain.
- Security: The desktop app serves a loopback-only bridge on `127.0.0.1:17865` and requires a session token; secrets are returned only on explicit fill.

## Security Notes

- **Master Password**: Choose a strong master password. This encrypts all your stored passwords.
- **Never Forget**: Your master password cannot be recovered. Store it safely.
- **Cloud Credentials**: Your cloud storage credentials are stored locally and encrypted.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Passwords are encrypted before being sent to cloud storage.
- **Local-First**: Even with cloud storage, all encryption happens on your device.
- **Activation Security**: Premium activation uses install ID + email + seller secret for secure verification.
